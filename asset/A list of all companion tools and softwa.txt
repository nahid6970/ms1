A list of all companion tools and software similar to Radarr
Just read a post by fellow redditor about Syncarr, which is a companion tool that can be used to sync up multiple instances of Radarr or Sonarr. It made me think of all such similar software which exist but people might not know of. I'm listing a few of them which I know. Maybe others can contribute to the list.
Edit: Thanks u/plissk3n for providing short descriptions.
