* ABOUT THE "CONFIGURING EMACS" VIDEO SERIES
"Configuring Emacs" is a series of videos where I take a standard installation of GNU Emacs and configure it into something more akin to Doom Emacs, complete with Evil Mode and all the customizations needed to make Emacs into something special.  This repo is broken up into subdirectories that are numbered (starting at 01).  The subdirectory numbers correspond to the number of the video in the series.  In each subdirectory you will find the Emacs configuration files as they existed at the time of that video.
