- Use =C-h b= to see ALL keybindings
- Use =C-h m= to see mode-specific shortcuts
- Look for =[+]= or =...= in which-key - means more pages available

** Customizing Shortcuts
- Add to your =init.el=: =(global-set-key (kbd "C-c x") 'your-function)=
- Use =C-h k= followed by a key to see what it currently does
- Your custom shortcuts will appear in which-key and =C-h b=

- =C-x= → File, buffer, window operations
- =M-x= → Execute any command by name
- =C-u= → Universal argument (modifies next command)
