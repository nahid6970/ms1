# MyHome Convex Implementation

The project has been refactored to use Convex with a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend.

## Files Created:
- `index.html`: The main dashboard frontend (Vanilla JS).
- `convex/functions.ts`: Backend queries and mutations for link management.
- `package.json`: Project configuration.

## How to Run:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npx convex dev` to start the Convex backend.
3. Copy the **Deployment URL** provided by the terminal (e.g., `https://happy-otter-123.convex.cloud`).
4. Open `index.html` and replace `YOUR_CONVEX_URL_HERE` with your actual URL.
5. Open `index.html` in any web browser.

The dashboard now supports real-time updates and persistent storage via Convex.
