OTTODEV + QWEN : FREE OPEN-SOURCE BOLT
Step 1: Install Git
Install Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads
Step 2: Install Node.js
Go to the Node.js download page: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Choose the prebuilt installer for Windows with LTS (Long Term Support) 
Step 3: Clone the Repo of OTTODEV
Run CMD with admin permissions
Type the following command and then press enter:
cd path\to\desktop
An example of what you could paste would be
cd C:\Users\guest\OneDrive\Desktop
Type the following command to clone the repository then press enter:
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm.git
Rename the downloaded folder OTTODEV
Step 4: Install Dependencies and Start the Application
Open CMD with admin permissions
Type the following command then press enter:
cd path\to\OTTODEV
Type the following command then press enter:
npm install -g pnpm
Type the following command then press enter:
pnpm install
Type the following command then press enter:
pnpm run dev
NOTE:
You will need the local host number for the next step, which will enable the browser to automatically open when running pnpm run dev.
Step 5: Configure the Dev Script (to open the browser automatically)
Locate and open the package.json file in the OTTODEV folder
Locate the dev line and modify it to add the following:
"dev": "remix vite:dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --open"
The 3000 port number needs to be modified to the local host number of step 4.
Step 6: Add a shortcut to launch OTTODEV
Create a new text document file.
Add the following lines:
@echo off
cd path\to\OTTODEV
pnpm run dev
Save the file with a .bat extension, for example, OTTODEV.bat
You can double click on it to open everything once you finish all the steps. You can even modify its icon so it feels like an app on your device.
Step 7: Install Ollama
Install Ollama from the official website: https://ollama.com/download
You can confirm Ollama was installed correctly by looking in the system tray.
This is a good resource for many of the Ollama commands:

Step 8: Install Qwen 2.5 Coder
Open CMD
Type the following command(s):
To install Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B:
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:32b
 If you want to download another smaller model or just a normal LLM, you can use the info on this site to figure out the command: https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder:32b
To verify it is installed correctly, it should appear when you type this in CMD: 
ollama list
Step 9: Increase the Ollama Context Window
Create a new txt file on Notepad. Name it "Modelfile". 
Add the following lines (example is for 32B):
FROM qwen2.5-coder:32b
PARAMETER num_ctx 32768

Just change the 32b to the same smaller model if you went with 14b or 7b
Open CMD and run this command:
ollama create -f path\to\Modelfile qwen2.5-coder-extra-ctx:32b
