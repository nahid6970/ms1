    *   **Geometry Nodes:** I can provide the logic for procedural hair, scales, or clothing.
    *   **Rigging & Skinning:** I can guide you through the "Weight Painting" process and troubleshooting deformation issues.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** I can identify and fix common issues like flipped normals, non-manifold geometry, or shader errors.

## 2. [MetaHuman Creator](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman) (Hyper-Realism)
A cloud-streamed app by Epic Games for creating photorealistic digital humans in minutes.

### Recommended Starting Point: **Blender**
Because Blender is highly scriptable via **Python**, I can provide the most direct "hands-on" help by giving you code that performs complex operations instantly.

**Example Task:** *"Help me write a Python script for Blender that generates a simple humanoid base mesh using spheres."*
