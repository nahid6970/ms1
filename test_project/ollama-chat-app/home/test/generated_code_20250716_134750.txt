Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Function Definitions:**  Uses well-named functions (`greet`, `add_numbers`, `is_positive`, `main`) to organize the code. This makes it much more readable and maintainable.
* **Docstrings:**  Includes docstrings (the triple-quoted strings) for each function.  This explains what the function does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.  This is *essential* for good code documentation.
* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block handles potential `ValueError` exceptions if the user enters non-numeric input.  This prevents the program from crashing.  It gracefully informs the user of the error and exits.
* **`if __name__ == "__main__":`:** This is a standard Python idiom.  It ensures that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module into another script).
* **f-strings:** Uses f-strings (e.g., `f"Hello, {name}! ..."`).  F-strings are the most modern and readable way to format strings in Python.
* **Comments:**  Includes comments to explain key parts of the code.
* **Modularity:** The code is broken down into logical units (functions), making it easier to understand and reuse.
* **User-Friendly Output:** The output is formatted to be clear and easy to read.
* **Handles floats:** The `add_numbers` function now accepts floats, making it more versatile.
* **Exits on invalid input:** The `main` function now exits if the user provides invalid input.

How to run the code:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `calculator.py`).
2.  **Run:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then, run the script using the command `python calculator.py`.
3.  **Follow the prompts:** The program will ask you for your name and two numbers.  Enter the values and press Enter after each.  The program will then print the greeting, the sum of the numbers, and whether the sum is positive or not.

This improved version is more robust, readable, and maintainable than a simple script.  It follows best practices for Python coding.
