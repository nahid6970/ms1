Python Programming Best Practices

1. Code Style and Formatting
- Use PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Keep line length under 79 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

2. Error Handling
- Use try-except blocks for error handling
- Be specific about which exceptions you catch
- Always clean up resources in finally blocks
- Log errors appropriately

3. Performance Tips
- Use list comprehensions instead of loops when possible
- Avoid global variables
- Use generators for large datasets
- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks

4. Testing
- Write unit tests for all functions
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

5. Documentation
- Write clear README files
- Document your API endpoints
- Include code examples in documentation
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
