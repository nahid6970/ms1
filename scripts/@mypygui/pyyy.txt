There are two ways to move the button to the left or right side of the window in Python Tkinter:

Using the side option:
The side option specifies where the widget should be placed relative to its parent widget. For a button, the possible values for the side option are TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, and RIGHT.

To move the button to the left side of the window, you can use the following code:

Python
backup_button = tk.Button(main_frame, text="Backup", command=open_backup_script, height=2, width=20, bg="white", fg="#1D2027", font=("JetBrainsMono Nerd Font", 12))

# Move the button to the left side of the window
backup_button.pack(side=tk.LEFT)
Use code with caution. Learn more
To move the button to the right side of the window, you can use the following code:

Python
backup_button = tk.Button(main_frame, text="Backup", command=open_backup_script, height=2, width=20, bg="white", fg="#1D2027", font=("JetBrainsMono Nerd Font", 12))

# Move the button to the right side of the window
backup_button.pack(side=tk.RIGHT)
Use code with caution. Learn more
Using the grid manager:
The grid manager allows you to place widgets in a grid-like formation. To move the button to the left or right side of the window using the grid manager, you can use the following code:

Python
backup_button = tk.Button(main_frame, text="Backup", command=open_backup_script, height=2, width=20, bg="white", fg="#1D2027", font=("JetBrainsMono Nerd Font", 12))

# Move the button to the left side of the window
backup_button.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=tk.W)

# Move the button to the right side of the window
backup_button.grid(row=0, column=1, sticky=tk.E)
Use code with caution. Learn more
The sticky option specifies how the widget should be aligned within the grid cell. In this case, we are using the tk.W and tk.E constants to align the button to the left and right side of the grid cell, respectively.

Which method you use to move the button to the left or right side of the window is up to you. I hope this helps!

The sticky=tk.W and sticky=tk.E options in Tkinter specify that the widget should be aligned to the left and right side of its grid cell, respectively.

This is useful for situations where you want to ensure that a widget is always aligned to one side of its grid cell, even if the size of the grid cell changes. For example, if you have a button that is placed in a grid cell with other widgets, and the size of the grid cell changes, the button will always be aligned to the left or right side of the grid cell, depending on which option you used.

Another use case for the sticky=tk.W and sticky=tk.E options is when you want to create a layout that is responsive to different window sizes. For example, if you have a button that is placed in a grid cell at the right side of the window, and the window size changes, the button will always be aligned to the right side of the window.

Here is an example of how to use the sticky=tk.W and sticky=tk.E options:

Python
import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()

# Create a frame
main_frame = tk.Frame(root)
main_frame.pack()

# Create a button
button = tk.Button(main_frame, text="Button")

# Align the button to the left side of the grid cell
button.pack(side=tk.LEFT, sticky=tk.W)

# Create another button
button2 = tk.Button(main_frame, text="Button2")

# Align the button to the right side of the grid cell
button2.pack(side=tk.RIGHT, sticky=tk.E)

root.mainloop()

In this example, the two buttons will always be aligned to the left and right side of the window, respectively, even if the window size changes.

I hope this helps!


There are two ways to align buttons vertically and horizontally when using the grid style in Tkinter:

Using the row and column options:
The row and column options specify the row and column in which the widget should be placed in the grid. To vertically align a button, you can use the row option. To horizontally align a button, you can use the column option.

For example, the following code will create two buttons that are aligned vertically in the first column of the grid:

Python
backup_button = tk.Button(main_frame, text="Backup", command=open_backup_script, height=2, width=20, bg="white", fg="#1D2027", font=("JetBrainsMono Nerd Font", 12))
restore_button = tk.Button(main_frame, text="Restore", command=open_restore_script, height=2, width=20, bg="white", fg="#1D2027", font=("JetBrainsMono Nerd Font", 12))

# Place the backup button in the first column of the grid, row 0
backup_button.grid(row=0, column=0)

# Place the restore button in the first column of the grid, row 1
restore_button.grid(row=1, column=0)
Use code with caution. Learn more
Using the sticky option:
The sticky option specifies how the widget should be aligned within the grid cell. The possible values for the sticky option are N, S, W, E, and NSEW.

To vertically align a button, you can use the N or S constants. To horizontally align a button, you can use the W or E constants. To center a button both vertically and horizontally, you can use the NSEW constant.

For example, the following code will create two buttons that are centered vertically and horizontally in the grid:

Python
backup_button = tk.Button(main_frame, text="Backup", command=open_backup_script, height=2, width=20, bg="white", fg="#1D2027", font=("JetBrainsMono Nerd Font", 12))
restore_button = tk.Button(main_frame, text="Restore", command=open_restore_script, height=2, width=20, bg="white", fg="#1D2027", font=("JetBrainsMono Nerd Font", 12))

# Center the backup button vertically and horizontally
backup_button.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky="NSEW")

# Center the restore button vertically and horizontally
restore_button.grid(row=1, column=0, sticky="NSEW")

The following table shows all the possible values for the sticky option in Tkinter:

Value	Description
N	Align the widget to the north side of the grid cell.
S	Align the widget to the south side of the grid cell.
W	Align the widget to the west side of the grid cell.
E	Align the widget to the east side of the grid cell.
NW	Align the widget to the northwest corner of the grid cell.
NE	Align the widget to the northeast corner of the grid cell.
SW	Align the widget to the southwest corner of the grid cell.
SE	Align the widget to the southeast corner of the grid cell.
NSEW	Center the widget both vertically and horizontally in the grid cell.
You can combine the N, S, W, and E constants to create custom alignments. For example, the following code will align the widget to the north and east sides of the grid cell:

Python
widget.grid(sticky="NE")
Use code with caution. Learn more
You can also use the sticky option in conjunction with the rowspan and columnspan options to control how the widget is placed in the grid. For example, the following code will align the widget to the north and east sides of the grid cell and span two columns:

Python
widget.grid(row=0, column=0, rowspan=1, columnspan=2, sticky="NE")
Use code with caution. Learn more
