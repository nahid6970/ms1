# 🚀 NeoPaint: Future Feature Roadmap

This document outlines potential features and enhancements to transform NeoPaint into a professional-grade web art studio.

## 🎨 Advanced Drawing & Art Tools
### 1. Layers System
- **Core Layers**: Multiple transparent layers with independent visibility toggles.
- **Blending Modes**: Multiply, Screen, Overlay, and Add.
- **Opacity Control**: Adjust layer transparency in real-time.
- **Merge/Flatten**: Combine layers for final exports.

### 2. Custom Brushes & Textures
- **Texture Engine**: Use images or noise patterns as brush "tips."
- **Dynamics**: Pressure sensitivity support (via Wacom/iPad) for size and opacity.
- **Dashing**: Implement dashed and dotted line styles for technical drawing.

### 3. Filters & Post-Processing
- **Live Filters**: Blur, Grayscale, Invert, Sepia, and Sharpen.
- **Color Grading**: Brightness, Contrast, Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (HSL) sliders.
- **Vignette & Noise**: Add stylistic film grain or focus effects.

## 🛠 Selection & Manipulation
### 4. Advanced Selection Tools
- **Lasso & Polygonal Lasso**: Freehand or click-based area selection.
- **Magic Wand**: Select areas by color similarity.
- **Transform Tools**: Move, Scale, Rotate, and Skew selected areas.

### 5. Smart Assets
- **Shape Library**: Pre-built symbols (Stars, Arrows, Speech Bubbles).
- **Import as Layer**: Drag and drop external images directly onto a new layer.

## ⚙️ Workflow & Integration
### 6. Animation Engine
- **Timeline UI**: Frame-by-frame animation at the bottom of the screen.
- **Onion Skinning**: See a ghost version of the previous frame while drawing.
- **Export to GIF/MP4**: Generate animated files directly in the browser.

### 7. Collaboration & Cloud
- **Live Collab**: Multi-user drawing on the same canvas via WebSockets.
- **Google Drive/Dropbox Sync**: Automatically backup "Gallery" files to the cloud.

---

## 📱 Mobile & Accessibility
### 8. Full Touch Support
- **Pinch-to-Zoom**: Native mobile gestures for the infinite canvas.
- **Radial Menu**: A touch-friendly "Quick Tool" wheel that follows the thumb.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Full UI theme toggling for different environments.

---

## 💾 Technical Enhancements
### 9. PDF & Vector Export
- **SVG Export**: Save shapes and lines as infinitely scalable vector files.
- **High-Res Export**: Option to upscale the canvas for printing (e.g., 300 DPI).

### 10. Plugin Architecture
- **API for Artists**: Allow users to write simple JS "Scripts" to generate procedural art (like Spirographs or Fractal generators).
