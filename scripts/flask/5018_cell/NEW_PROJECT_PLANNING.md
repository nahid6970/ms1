# New Project Planning: Markdown-First Single-Column Sheet System

## 1. Vision & Architecture
This project involves a complete overhaul of the `5018_cell` application, transitioning from a multi-column spreadsheet to a vertically-optimized, Markdown-native content curator.

### Core Architectural Shift:
- **Vertical Orientation**: Each sheet contains exactly **one column** and multiple rows (blocks). This removes the complexity of horizontal scrolling and refocuses on vertical content flow.
- **Unified Markdown Interface**: Removal of the "Raw Mode" toggle. The application will operate exclusively in a **Live Preview / Hybrid Mode**.
    - **Editing**: Users edit raw Markdown syntax directly. Highlighting and basic formatting (bold, color) are applied to the syntax tokens *while* editing.
    - **Viewing**: When not focused, the content is rendered into its final polished form (Large headers, math symbols, etc.).
- **Persistence Layer**: Data remains synchronized with `data.json` via the Flask backend, but the JSON schema will be flattened to prioritize a continuous row-based list for each sheet.

## 2. Comprehensive Feature Index (To be Ported)

### A. The "Omni-Markdown" Parsing Engine & Custom Color Core
The new system will prioritize a highly flexible, user-extensible coloring system.

1.  **Primary Coloring: The Custom Syntax Engine**:
    *   **Core Logic**: Instead of hardcoded regex for every color, the application will rely on a dynamic **Custom Syntax Registry** (seeded by `custom_syntaxes.json`).
    *   **User-Defined Markers**: Users can define any marker (e.g., `++`, `%%`, `¿¿`) and pair them with `bgColor`, `fgColor`, `isBold`, etc.
    *   **Flexible Adaptation**: This system is the "source of truth" for coloring. If a user wants a new highlight color, they simply add a marker definition rather than modifying the parser code.

2.  **Highlight & Highlight Presets (The "Standard Library")**:
    *   **Core Presets**: Built-in support for standard markers (e.g., `==`, `!!`, `??`).
    *   **Full Customization**: These presets can be extended or modified within the Custom Syntax Registry to fit any design system.
    *   **Marker-First Philosophy**: All visual emphasis is achieved via short, memorable symbols, keeping the raw markdown readable and easy to type.

3.  **Text Formatting & Scripts**:
    *   Emphasis: Bold (`**`), Italic (`@@`), Underline (`__`), Strikethrough (`~~`).
    *   Sizing: Multi-level Headings (`##`), Variable sized markers (`#2#Text#/#`), and Small text (`..text..`).
    *   Scripts: Superscript (`^`) and Subscript (`~`).
3.  **Layout & Structure**:
    *   Lists: Multi-level indented bullets (`-`, `--`, `---`) and auto-numbered lists.
    *   Separators: Styled horizontal lines with color mapping (`R-----G`).
    *   Tables: Support for Pipe and Comma-delimited tables embedded *within* the single-column rows.
    *   Containers: Border boxes (`#B#Box Content#/#`) for emphasizing blocks of text.
4.  **Special Logic**:
    *   **KaTeX Math**: Full LaTeX support (`\( \)` ) with specialized "Smart Fraction" conversion for rapid entry.
    *   **Word Connectors**: Dynamic SVG/Canvas lines connecting terms marked with `[1]term`.
    *   **Interactive Content**: 
        *   Collapsible blocks `{{ hidden }}`.
        *   Correct Answer blocks `[[ answer ]]`.
        *   Checkbox states (Completion tracking).
    *   **Timeline/Flow**: Automated vertical flowcharts using `Timeline*` syntax.

### B. UI/UX & Navigation Systems
1.  **Sidebar (The Tree)**:
    *   Hierarchical organization: Categories > Sheets > Sub-sheets.
    *   Dynamic management: Rename, Move, and Delete via right-click or icons.

            *   **CRUD Operations**: Inline creation (➕) and right-click context menus for instant Rename/Delete.
        *   **Sheet Organization**: 
            *   **Sub-sheet Nesting**: Toggle visibility of parent/child sheet hierarchies with the 📂 (folder) tool.
            *   **Visual Separators**: Add and manage non-functional "spacer" lines within categories to group related sheets visually.
            *   **Interactive List**: Direct click-to-switch with keyboard-ready `Enter` support for the top search result.
            *   **Management**: Right-click for "Move to Category", Rename (with Nickname support), and Delete.
    *   **F2 (History - "Vertical Recents")**: 
        *   **Chronological Tracking**: List of recently visited sheets with the most recent at the top.
        *   **Smart Labels**: Displays Sub-sheet relationships (e.g., "Sheet [Parent]").
        *   **Fast Jump**: Numbered shortcuts (#1, #2...) for even faster switching.
    *   **F3 (Quick Format - "Selection Power-Tool")**: 
        *   **Standard Formatting**: Buttons for Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, etc.
        *   **Dynamic Markers**: Instant access to `##` Headings, `#2#` Big Text, `..` Small text, and `_R_` Colored underlines.
        *   **Custom Syntax Shelf**: A dynamic section that automatically populates buttons for every marker defined in `custom_syntaxes.json` (e.g., `++`, `%%`, `¿¿`).
        *   **KaTeX Math Assistant (Modal)**: 
            *   **Visual Editor**: A specialized math icon that opens an assistant window.
            *   **Template Fields**: Dedicated input boxes for **Numerators**, **Denominators**, **Square Roots** (`\sqrt{}`), and **Exponents**.
            *   **Instant LaTeX Generation**: Build complex expressions by filling in the boxes; the window automatically generates the corresponding `\( ... \)` KaTeX string.
            *   **Smart Insertion**: Clicking "OK" inserts the perfectly formatted math string at the cursor position.
        *   **Advanced Tools**: Smart fraction detection (`a/b` conversion), Link creation, and Google Search.

## 3. Rebuild Strategy (The "New Rule of 6")
To ensure consistency in the new architecture, every content-feature must be unified across:
1.  **Unified Parser**: A single, parameterized JS function handling both "Clean" view and "Hybrid" edit mode.
2.  **Detection**: Robust `checkHasMarkdown` logic for autosize and overlay triggers.
3.  **Search Transparency**: `stripMarkdown` ensures that rich formatting doesn't break multi-term searching.
4.  **Static Mirror**: Equivalent Python-based parsing in `export_static.py` for identical offline views.
5.  **Focus Logic**: Seamless transition between transparent editing and polished viewing with **zero cursor jumping**.
6.  **Style Tokens**: Centralized CSS variables for themes (Light/Dark/Cyberpunk) and custom syntaxes.

## 4. Immediate Planning Objectives
*   **Data Migration**: Convert existing multi-column `data.json` to a single-column array format.
*   **Overlay Elimination**: Refactor the preview logic to use a background-content strategy where the styled output sits directly behind the transparent input.
*   **Refresh Persistence**: Ensure the Flask backend captures "Last Sheet" and "Last Cursor" states for a truly seamless reload experience.
