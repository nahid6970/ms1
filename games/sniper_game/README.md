# S.N.I.P.E.R - Elite Hunter

**Elite Hunter** is a browser-based tactical shooter game where you play as a sniper defending a safe house from waves of armed insurgents. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the experience focuses on immersion, "cursor-less" aiming, and tactical decision-making.

## 🎯 Game Overview
The player is stationed in a fixed position overlooking a mountain pass road. Enemies spawn from the left and advance towards the **Safe House** located on the far right. Your mission is to neutralize all threats before they breach the perimeter and destroy the objective.

## ✨ Key Features
*   **Safe House Defense**: Protect your base from incoming attackers. If the Safe House HP reaches 0%, the mission is a failure.
*   **Wave System**: 
    *   Combat escalates in waves.
    *   Wave 1 starts with a single scout.
    *   Enemy count doubles each subsequent wave (Human Wave Attack tactics), capping at 15 concurrent hostiles.
*   **Dynamic Enemies**:
    *   **Tactical AI**: Enemies march down the road and assume combat stances to fire when in range.
    *   **Sprinters**: 20% of enemies are speed-boosted, requiring quick prioritization.
    *   **Visuals**: Detailed CSS character models with tactical gear, weapon handling animations, and muzzle flashes.
*   **Immersive Mechanics**: 
    *   High-power scope with simulated sway and visual magnification.
    *   Realistic damage: Headshots are instant kills; body shots require double-taps.
    *   Day/Night atmospheric lighting with street lamps.
*   **Arsenal**:
    *   10-Round Magazine.
    *   Select Fire: Semi-Auto (Precision) vs Full-Auto (Crowd Control).
