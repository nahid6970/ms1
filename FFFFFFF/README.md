# AutoHotkey (AHK) GUI Manager

A powerful PyQt6 application for visually managing, searching, and generating AutoHotkey v2 scripts. This tool eliminates the need for manual script editing and provides a "Shortcut Builder" to avoid system-level hotkey conflicts during setup.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Visual Shortcut Builder (⌨)**: Construct complex hotkeys (like `Ctrl+Alt+T`) by clicking modifier buttons and searching for keys. No more system-level shortcuts triggering while you try to assign them!
- **Searchable Interface**: Instantly find shortcuts by name, key, description, or category.
- **Category Organization**: Group shortcuts into categories (System, Navigation, Media, etc.) with custom color coding.
- **Two Shortcut Types**:
    - **Script Shortcuts**: Runs AutoHotkey v2 code when a hotkey is pressed.
    - **Text Shortcuts (Hotstrings)**: Replaces a typed trigger (e.g., `;v2`) with replacement text. **Automatically handles special characters (#, !, etc.) and multiline text literally.**

## 🛠 How to Add New Scripts

To add a new script to the GUI, follow these steps:

1. **Launch the App**: Run `ahk_gui_pyqt.py`.
2. **Add Shortcut**: Click the **+ Add** button and select **Script Shortcut**.
3. **Set Hotkey**: Use the keyboard icon (**⌨**) next to the Hotkey field to open the **Shortcut Builder**. Click Ctrl/Alt/Shift and select your main key.
4. **Input Action**: Paste your AHK v2 code into the **Action** text box.

### Important: Multi-line Logic
- If your script is a **single line** (e.g., `Run "notepad.exe"`), the GUI will generate it as `Hotkey::Action`.
- If your script has **multiple lines**, the GUI **automatically wraps** it in `{ }` braces. You don't need to add them yourself unless you are defining internal functions or blocks.

### 💡 Best Practice: Use Functions for Everything
For the best experience when sharing code with AI (like me!) or writing your own, **always wrap your logic inside a function**.

**Why?**
1. It avoids "variable name conflicts" between different shortcuts.
2. It makes the code much cleaner when pasted into the GUI.
3. It ensures that variables defined inside the function don't accidentally "leak" into other parts of your AHK script.

**The "Clean Format" to use:**
```autohotkey
; Give your function a unique name
MyAwesomeAction() {
    ; All your script logic goes here
    MsgBox("Action complete!")
}

; Then just call it inside the Hotkey in the GUI:
MyAwesomeAction()
```

## 📝 AHK v2 Script Examples

Here are some common snippets you can copy and paste into the **Action** box:

### Open a Website
```autohotkey
Run "https://www.google.com"
```

### Launch an App (with specific working directory)
```autohotkey
Run "C:\Path\To\YourApp.exe", "C:\Path\To\"
```

### Type Custom Text (using Send)
```autohotkey
Send "Best regards,{Enter}Nahid Ahmed"
```

### Move/Resize Window
```autohotkey
WinMove(0, 0, 800, 600, "A") ; Moves the Active window to top-left and resizes
```

### Toggle Volume
```autohotkey
Send "{Volume_Mute}"
```

### Multi-line Power Script
```autohotkey
if WinExist("ahk_class Notepad")
    WinActivate
else
    Run "notepad.exe"
```

## 📂 Project Structure

- `ahk_gui_pyqt.py`: The main Python application logic and UI.
- `ahk_shortcuts.json`: Your database of saved shortcuts (automatically managed).
- `generated_shortcuts.ahk`: The output file you run with AutoHotkey v2.

## ⚠️ Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **PyQt6**: `pip install PyQt6`
- **AutoHotkey v2**: Required to run the generated `.ahk` file.
